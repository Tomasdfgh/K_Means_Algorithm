The K Means Algorithm boils down to 3 fundamental steps:

1. Cluster Initialization
2. Cluster Assignment to a specific centroid
3. Move centroid to the center of the cluster

In this project, the first step is done by randomly picking n number of data points if the algorithm calls for n clusters, and assign the coordinates of each of those n clusters to be the same as the coordinate of the n data points. I created a 3D graph containing about 20 data points in 3 dimensions to illustrate the movements of the clusters.
